The ATM Interface is a Java-based console application that simulates the basic functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). This project provides a real-world scenario of how ATMs work, focusing on core banking operations. It is a great example of how Java can be used to create complex, interactive systems.

Project Overview:
When the application starts, the user is prompted to enter their user ID and PIN. Upon successful authentication, the ATM functionalities become accessible, allowing the user to perform various banking operations.
